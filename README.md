# Assignment-for-NLP
Creation of Objective Questions with Multiple Correct Answers using generative text models


Objective
The goal of this internship assignment is to test your proficiency in natural language
processing. You will be tasked with developing a solution that can automatically generate
objective questions with multiple correct answers based on a given chapter from a subject.
The generated questions should test the reader's understanding of the chapter and have
more than one possible correct answer to increase the complexity and challenge of the
questions.The generated questions should not only test the reader's comprehension of the
chapter but also encourage them to think beyond the surface level and explore different
perspectives and possibilities. Ultimately, the objective of this project is to develop a robust
and accurate solution that can aid educators in creating engaging and challenging
assessments for their students.

Context:
Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into
chemical energy that, through cellular respiration, can later be released to fuel the organism's
activities. Some of this chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars and
starches, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water – hence the name photosynthesis,
from the Greek phōs, "light", and synthesis , "putting together". Most plants, algae, and
cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis
is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere,
and supplies most of the energy necessary for life on Earth.
Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins
when energy from light is absorbed by proteins called reaction centers that contain green chlorophyll
(and other colored) pigments/chromophores. In plants, these proteins are held inside organelles
called chloroplasts, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in
the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons
from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting
of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy,
enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the "energy currency" of cells.
In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of
light-independent reactions called the Calvin cycle. In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide
is incorporated into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate
(RuBP).[5] Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting
compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other
bacteria, different mechanisms such as the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end.
The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most
likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of
electrons. Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to
the oxygenation of the Earth, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. Today, the
average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 terawatts, which is
about eight times the current power consumption of human civilization. Photosynthetic organisms
also convert around 100–115 billion tons (91–104 Pg petagrams, or billion metric tons), of carbon
into biomass per year. That plants receive some energy from light – in addition to air, soil, and water
– was first discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz.
